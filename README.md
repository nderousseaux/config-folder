# My configuration

## Apps
Whith `yabai`, each app is assigned to a space : 
1. Console / bdd
2. backend / figma
3. code
4. web
5. Office
6. Office
7. notes
8. Calendar/Reminder
9. Pro communication
10. Music / Communication

## Shortcuts
I use `skhd` and `yabai` to manage my windows and shortcuts.

### Space control
For navigation between spaces, I use the following shortcuts, with `skhd`:

`rshift + 1-0` : Go to space 1-10
`ralt + 1-0` : Move the current window to space 1-10
`ralt + rshift + 1-0` : Move the current window to space 1-10 and follow it.

## Edit
You can edit the folder `vars.sh` to change the variables of the system, like assigniation of apps to spaces.
